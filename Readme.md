## Description
This is a barebone messaging application ( not something extra-ordinary ) built using Node, Express and Socket.io.

## Motive 
- for my own learning 
- to know about how Socket.io works behind the scenes
- to know how a realtime messaging application can be built in a simple yet effective manner
